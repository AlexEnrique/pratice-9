  The program \texttt{laplace.py} aims to solve the \textit{Laplace's Equation}, $\laplacian{\phi} = 0$, for an electrostatic potential $\phi$ on a square plate, subject to the boundary conditions
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
      \phi = 1.0 V \qc x = 0, \\
      \phi = 0.0 V \qc x = L, \ y = 0, \qor y = L.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  The program makes use of \textit{divided differences method} to solve the equation. In two dimensions, the equation takes the form
  \begin{equation}
    \pdv[2]{\phi}{x} + \pdv[2]{\phi}{y} = 0.
    \label{eq:1}
  \end{equation}
  Our method consists of dividing the domain of $\phi$ (the square plate) into a grid of small squares\footnote{It could be another form insted of squares.} and using the approximation for the derivative via Taylor expansion, truncaded at first order:
  \begin{equation*}
    \pdv[2]{\phi}{x} (x,y) = \frac{\phi(x - a, y) + \phi(x + a, y) - 2 \phi (x, y)}{a^2},
  \end{equation*}
  and the same for the $y$ variable. Using this and putting into the equation (\ref{eq:1}), we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{a^2} \qty[\phi(x - a, y) + \phi(x + a, y) + \phi(x, y - a) + \phi(x, y + a) - 4 \phi (x, y)] = 0,
  \end{equation*}
  and, rearranging,
  \begin{equation}
    \phi(x,y) = \frac{1}{4} \qty[\phi(x - a, y) + \phi(x + a, y) + \phi(x, y - a) + \phi(x, y + a)].
    \label{eq:2}
  \end{equation}

  Because we divided the domain into small squares, the $(x,y)$ point can be interpreted as a center of a square with side length equal to $a$. So, $(x+a,y)$, $(x-a,y)$, $(x,y-a)$ and $(x, y + a)$ are the first (squares) neighbors.

  Equation (\ref{eq:2}) enables us to solve the problem. We fix the potential at the boundaries and guess the values\footnote{It does not need to be acurated.} of $\phi$ as a first to calculate new values for the potential $\phi^\prime$ via (\ref{eq:2}), where $\phi^\prime$ is the left hand side and the right hand side we use the values of phi. After the calculations, we set $\phi \texttt{[} \texttt{]} \texttt{[} \texttt{]} = \phi^\prime \texttt{[} \texttt{]} \texttt{[} \texttt{]}$ and iterate over and over. This method is known as \textit{Jacobi Method}.

  We can chose between several stop conditions for the program. The used in \texttt{laplace.py} is that the maximum diference between $\phi$ and $\phi^\prime$ be lass than a target value (the target accuracy defined at line 7).

  The flowchart on the next page shows more explicitly the process explained above.

  Running the program, we get a graph. The picture produced is displayed below.
